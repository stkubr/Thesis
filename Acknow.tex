\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Christian Fischer, for providing
me the opportunity to work with him, for provided insightful discussions about the research carried out in this
thesis, and for his help and patience during my PhD studies. I am thankful to Prof. Dr. Wolfgang K{\"u}hn for being my second PhD advisor and I am also very grateful to the members of my dissertation committee: Prof. Dr. Kai-Thomas Brinkmann, Prof. Dr. Lorenz von Smekal and Prof. Dr. Martin Buhmann. \\

The members of the Prof. Fischer group have contributed immensely to my personal and
professional time. I appreciate my colleagues like Richard Williams, Helios Sanchis-Alepuz and Gernot Eichmann for being a irreplaceable source of good advice and collaboration. Thanks to my officemates, specifically Walter Heupel, Tobias Goecke and Vitaliy Shklar for resolving and explaining a lot of scientific and programming questions. Many thanks to Christian Welzbacher for rescuing my "Aufenthaltstitel" from Italy, while I was penetrating the customs of European Union without one. I would like to express my gratitude to all PhD and MS students and staff of the Institute of Theoretical Physics for a friendly working atmosphere. \\

My special thanks goes to my friends, two charming financial sharks, Carina Popovici and Stefan Strauss, for all scientific and not-very-scientific "Water Melon Club" discussions we had, the immense influence on my vision of the life and for being the encouraging example to me. \\

I will forever be thankful to my former research advisor in SFedU, Gregory Vereshkov. On behalf of all his students I would like to express my gratefulness for the knowledge and the life vector he taught us. \\

Last but not least, my thanks go to my family for their encouragement, patience, and support throughout all my studies.
